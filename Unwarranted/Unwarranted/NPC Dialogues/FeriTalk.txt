[Opening]
Hm? Jack was it? Listen, I don't have much time before I'm on, so make it snappy hun~

[Show poster]
Oh!! It's the sweet little Chimieric that used to come by!~ Well- they were once.
Oh- something terrible happened to them? Almost serves them right...
We had to- ah- change some policies around here. Chimerics are no longer allowed.
We had some staff report being harassed and I will NOT stand for anyone harming my gals.
Then, this cheeky little lad thinks they can just keep on entering by sneaking in? We had to. Kick. Them. Out.
For LIFE.
Maybe I felt a little bad... but not really.

[Show lines from Sprocket (105, 108, 109)]
Do you mean that gross little creature out there really thinks they should be let in?? GUH-ROHSS.
In fact- I don't even want them on our street corner.
Maybe I'll send the guards like how I sent them for that rowdy, dumb Chimeric...

[Present her own line about the guard]
Hwha?? No, I didn't mean it like that!
Plus... you have no physical proof I'd do something like that!
+fear

[Present broken bottle]
Where did you find that?! In OUR establishment??
Wait- you can't be trying to link me to this- you just can't do that. You got absolutely nothing on me, hun.
You're missing a motive- or a means- or something I don't know how it works!
+anger

[Opening with fear and anger {JACKPOT}]
Alright, listen up buttercup.
I'm getting WAY too worked up other this. The stress is gonna make me wrinkle...
Maybe I didn't like that Chimeric's advances. MAYBE I told them to shove off. Maybe it got physical.
But I swear I just hit them once! And they left! Well- my bodyguard went after them...
You can't arrest me- that can't possibly be enough right? So... Don't even try!
