[Base Conversation]
Ay Jack's back. Comin' in for another round?
Oh yeah- Rat was here a while back. He was braggin' about having dirt on Kog. Go ask him about it.
I can't really ever trust the guy. I think he knows I like gossip enough t'forget to be on 'is ass about his tab.
Also, you seen Arthur around? I know it's hard to find him sometimes.

[Inquire line 3]
You don't know Kog? Are you drunk again? You haven't bought one thing and I need to cut ya off already.
Kog is the Terrian who runs the workshop down by the docks.
He makes Etheris powered machines to help with minin' new ores.
I don't quite remember why Rat was goin' off about 'im. I stopped paying attention.

[Inquire line 5]
Hes been goofing off again somewhere- maybe not even in this plane.
If you see him, tell him hey. And to get back over here. I'm bored. Day's slow.

[Show Missing Persons Poster]
Hm? I've seen this guy around before. Ya'know they're not the first Chimeric to just up and disappear?
Nah this has been a regular thing. I chalk it up t'general stigma.
I think this guy worked as onea the freight company workers.
They work out of the docks, takin' stuff up to the Inner Ring an... stuff.
Whats with the feather though?

[Show lines 62, 63, 64, 65, or 73 from libraryBooks]
Ah dude get that sh-stuff outta here.
I hate hearing about The King- it's a gross stereotype that all Chimeric believe 'im.
Although, truth be told- I did once.
Now don't go twistin' my words Monty- I'm done with that life. Borderline cult.
I'm sure there's still plennya suckers in there though. Good luck finding them- they hide in plain sight...

[Base conversation (Library)]
Greetings inspector- or- Jack. Just Jack.
How has life been treating you?
I have been flitting between here and there so really I just keep losing track of your whereabouts.
Have you started your next case yet? Have you concluded it? I hope you find the culprit is not me.
Of course, I am not, but how amusing would that be?
I am too busy Wandering the planes searching for tales to tell.

[Inquire line 35]
We both know I need to be constantly traveling for fuel for my lastest works.
Being a world renouned author is an undertaking, but I am humble enough to manage~

[Inquire line 38, or line 67]
Come on Jack- you must know this by now? Have you forgotten everything?
Is this exposition just a plot device for a shoddy school assignment?
I am in the unfortunately fortunate position of being in posession of enough magic to leave.
As in- leave this reality. Into another. And trust me, there is plenty to see.
Most of my work details everything I have seen in all my traveling.
But don't tell that to the audience back on Terra... I do not think they could comprehend that.
And while this has made me sucsessful- it also comes with one major drawback:
Time itself flows differently for me- since I can be any where at any time.
Maybe this doesn't sound bad... But it is so hard to keep track of! To prevent... spoilers.
I may see you later today- from your view- it could be any time for me. We shall see!

[Present line 15 from minorNPCsTalk]
Oh- I will be back soon. He knows I am always back before long.
I bet he thinks I am much further than I am- truth be told I was too lazy to Wander today.

[Present Missing Person Poster]
I cannot tell you anything about this. As I have no way to know when I am.
I cannot be giving you any kind of spoilers... especially after last time.
Or has that not happened yet?

[Base conversation (Square)]
Greetings again Jack! Or maybe this is the first time we have spoken today? Hm.
Oh yes that gets confusing. Reguardless, good luck in whatever case it is you are pursuing.
Unless you are not doing that anymore? But then you resu- wait- spoilers.

[Present Missing Person Poster]
(Reference library dialogue).

SELENE [LINES 74 THROUGH 95] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CYAN
Morning Jack!! Or afternoon... or evening. I can't be bothered to check the time.
Oh oh Marideth told me you're starting a new case!! How exciting~
If you need ANYTHING I'll be here to try my best to help! If I know something anyways.
Certainly I'd be more more help to you than Arthur...

[Inquire line 77]
I'm very mad at Arthur! To know he can just pop into the future and come back.
He could be solving so many problems, all by telling us how to avoid them!!
I know it's not nearly that simple... but I can't help but think he could be doing more.
More than just profiting off the history of other worlds- marketing it as "fiction".

[Present Missing Person Poster]
Hmm... I've seen this Chimeric before... They work for the company that transports goods from the docks.
I think that Chimeric helps manage the cargo going to and from the Inner Ring.
Try some of the people there. I know those guys are hard to talk to but they've just gotta know something!!

[Show line 15 from libraryBooks]
AUGH- Thanks for bringing this to attention Jack...
I'm so sick of people RUINING the books here!! Do they realize how old some of these are?
I'm not even sure who could be doing it... But I've seen that feather around before.
I don't think it means anything really?- Just a simple design people can replicate easily.

SPROCKET [LINES 97 THROUGH 109] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- YELLOW
Heya Inspector Montenegro! On your way to the Pen & Dragon again?
Or maybe you came to watch little old me play! No? Alright. That's fair.
Hey hey hey have you been to Feri's Palace yet? It's pretty close to the Pen & Dragon.
Iii knooow it's not really your thing- but! You should mix it up every now and again.
Plus... maybe you could uh... help me sneak in so I can watch Feri preform. She's so cool...

[Inquire lines 99 and 101]
You don't know about Feri?! Shes a singer- no- an Artist~ So inspiring...
Uhm- saddly the Palace is very restrictive of who gets let in...
And uh- I guess Half Breeds like me aren't on the list- so I can't get in.
I tried a disguise once but uh... I got too eager and at some point messed up and got caught.
Chimerics are also on the non-entry list, which is really unfair! They get pushed around enough as is...
If I could enter, I'd try to appeal to management- I bet it's not Feri who asked for this!

RAT [LINES 112 THROUGH 130] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DARKMAGENTA
Jackyyyy boyy... what're you doin around here in this place?
The folk in this place'll eat you up- you need someone awesome and couragous like me to help you.
Oh also- you got any Muns on you? I need some change for uh... a friend.
Or we could talk about something else... wanna take a stab at what I found out?~

[Inquire line 115]
Noo I'm not gonna just TELL YOU thats no fuuun...
I'm sure I've blabbed about it to someone- go ask them and come back to me when you figured it out.

[Present line 3 from minorNPCsTalk {Jackpot}]
Ooooh you heard from Ceris huh?~
Alright- ye'ver heard of the place people go to buy and sell... less savory items?
Contraband- like exotic animals, Spellstones of a higher grade, organs and stuff.
If you get into contact with Kog somehow- ask him about the Masked Market.
Word is he's been selling some of his invovative tech to enemy countries for big bucks.
Not only that but he's using filtered Pure Etheris in some of his stuff- y'know how they get that?
Two ways- a looong boring distilling process with liquid Etheris...
Or you extract it from magical creatures...
ANYWAAAAYS I've said enough. Go find some stuff out on your own for a change. Freeloader.

RUBINIA [LINES 133 THROUGH 144] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RED
Good day inspector. Hope you're doing well enough.
You're probably looking for my husband Rutherian, he's in the next room over.
Unless theres something you want to ask me...?

[Present Missing Person Poster]
Oh dear... another one? It's so dangerous for Chimerics like us to live here in Lux.
I feel more safe with everything here in the Inner Ring but... The Outter City?
It's far too dangerous.

[Present Pure Etheris Vial or Stained Dagger]
Where did you find this?...
This is gross... This better not be from a Chimeric.

DOCKS WORKER [LINES 147 THROUGH 154] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kinda busy here. Unless you have something worth my time, scram.

[Resent Missing Person Poster]
Woah- I can't believe it- its them.
Okay look- I had nothing to do with it I just worked with the guy. 
He worked the Inner Ring- He made deliveries to some Dragon named uuuh... started with...
C? No thats not right- A dragon with a name like that wouldn't live in the Inner Ring.
Anyways, just seek them out.

Greetings travler... Yes yes... Have you come to listen to me preach the ways of Our Lord, The King?
Or maybe... You're here to view my wares? YOU WILL BUY MY WARES yes.

[Inquire first line]
I was once in the coven of The King yes... BUT THEY LEFT ME they kicked me out...
I was cast aside- my use had expired. I gave them EVERYTHING (except my wares).
Their motives- their ways- they have been evolving since the rise of our New Leader.
He IMPOSSIBLY claims to be more powerful than The King himself. Yes yes this is BLASPHEMOUS.
You will find him because you have found him... But do not provoke him.
He is full of wrath and wishes to mess with the order of LIFE ITSELF. Or Death itself Yes.
...To become an X Class Chimeric... one would first have to brave death after all.

[Inquire last line]
Yes yes I am selling CRAM. I am selling multiple Crams very different flavors. Yes yes.
I have Raspberry, Berry, and VERY BERRY.
(I reccomend the Very Berry it is like Berry Cram, but VERY).
ONLY 20 Gold Coins for ONE... BUCKET OF CRAM I sell them by the bucket.
You will receive Cram upon paying me 20 Gold Coins!
PAY THE COIN you will receive the Raspberry, Berry or VERY BERRY Cram.
WHAT is Cram you ask? What is it made of?
...
...
...
... The question confuses me...

UNIVERSAL REACTIONS [LINES 184 THROUGH X] ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Present Free Sample of Cram]
What is that stuff? Get it out of here!
