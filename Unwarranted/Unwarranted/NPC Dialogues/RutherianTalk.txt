[Opening] Rutherian is the best character to write I spent way too long on this please don't be mad...
Hello Inspector Montenegro!
Are you surprised I recognized you? Your reputation is still fairly well known up here.
Is there anything I can help you with today? I will do my absolute best to assist!

[Show poster w/out having gotten money]
Oh! Oh, I recognize this Chimeric...
Inspector, are you actually going to take this case? I'd be so grateful if you do...
I've been trying to implore that the city officials take this case but they keep shrugging me off.
These disappearances have been happening for months and so they've just given up.
I'll tell you what I know: This Chimeric worked with the transportation company.
They helped transport goods all across the Citadel, all the way from the docks to up here.
I know for a fact they delivered to Kog and Seren- if you've heard of those two people.
Kog has a workshop down by the docks, Seren runs a lab here in the Inner Ring. They both work with Etheris based tech.
That's all I have for now inspector. 
Oh but first- take some pocket change- just don't spend it all at once.
Anything for one of the few humans I've seen kind enough to want to help us...

>repeat dialogue after “I'll tell you what I know” but before money giving.

[Opening After Day 3]
It's so unfortunate what happened to Feri... Jack... I know you can get to the bottom of this.
This is so much better than just a handful of Chimerics now. 
I'll tell you anything more I know- about the Beak-Masks, about the Spectre, just ask.

[Inquire on the last line]
The Beak-Masks... They work for the Spectre- you could have guessed that.
The Spectre themselves- they've been haunting the Inner Ring for some time now. Raiding citizens and stealing money.
They're preparing for something.
The outfit they wear seems to be eluding to an incarnation of Fuoro'For. Maybe it's a religious gathering? But why would they be stealing...

[Show vial]
Where did you find this? It's liquid Etheris yes? Hand it to me for a second...
Hm... it smells Chimeric in origin. They're one of the two races that bleed Etheris like this.
Does the fact I can deduce this surprise you? Because of the amount of Etheris in my own body, all my senses are heightened.
Wherever you found this... this may be the key to finding the missing Chimerics.

[Show dagger]
This is troubling... deeply unsettling.
Only two races in Orrim bleed Etheris like this- and one of them being Chimerics.
So surely... it wouldn't be? Why would a Chimeric be hurting their own kind?
Our sense of kin runs deep inspector- please don't go and accuse my kind of such an act...

[Any lines from the Beak-Mask about Rutherian (163, 164, 165, 166)]
Hm? You met a Beak-Mask where? I suppose that doesn't matter WHY you were there...
It sounds like the ramblings of a crazed lunatic. I wouldn't trust a word of it.

[Line from the Beak-Mask about X-Class Chimerics (167)]
Ah, so you've heard about X-Classes before? That's dangerous magic there Inspector.
X-Class Chimerics have a dangerously high amount of Etheris in their bodies.
It warps their minds and souls and physically transforms them into monsters.
There was once an X-Class Chimeric who found out how to stop the negative impacts while retaining the inherent power though.
They say all his research was stolen... You may know his son- he works at a run-down bar in the Outer Ring.



inspector GET HIS ASS

[Dialogue outside of interrogations- ie in the Hideout] ======================================================================================-
Jack... Please... I come to you not as a sponsor but as a friend...
They took Rubi... They took her and I don't know what to do...
I know where they went- I can show you- just please hurry.

I had no idea... All of this- under the citadel the whole time?
This just can't be right...

Oh... Oh! Rubi! I'm SO glad we finally found you! And unscathed...
Hm- it's not as fun to keep the act up now that we've gone this far. Let's start over maybe? I was having so much fun...
Don't look at me like that Inspector- we had SO many good times didn't we? Weren't you having fun thinking you were about to solve this case?
The case of all the missing Chimerics? Of the messiah who was capturing them to make them perfect?
I sure was- in fact it's the reason I decided to bring you here and out myself- because, and let's be real:
Who would listen to you anyway?
Poor little Jackllyn- a man who just crumbled and fell apart after losing his wife; doing his job.
No... Unlike the cases you could have had with the others, you have no physical proof on me.
So who's more trustworthy... a nobleman who's been supporting this city for years?
...Or a lazy drunk who fled when the city needed him most?

Auck, why don't you JUST GIVE UP? GIVE UP INSPECTOR.
SURROUND HIM. I THOUGHT I'D END THIS MYSELF BUT I SEE NOW WHY THAT'S DIFFICULT.
SQUIRM OUT OF THIS ONE YOU INSOLENT WORM.

Oh? You're back.
Inspector, I'm so sorry... last time I just exploded at you- that was very... unwarranted.
You have to understand though- I'm doing this not for personal gain, but the goodness of my heart.
You know Chimerics used to be the dominant race of Orrim? Before the humans hunted us like animals?
I'm just making a way for us to fight back against them... X-Class Chimerics- they're our perfect and most pure form.
Thanks to machines from Kog, and samples from Seren, our own labs were able to figure out a way to transform normal chimerics...
Into their more beautiful and pure counterparts.
And finding test subjects was so much easier after we bribed Feri to kick Chimerics out of her establishment!
So many of my poor kin on the streets... during the night... so dangerous! So profitable~
And now I think it's about time I ascend myself- I'll allow myself to be one of the first few to taste perfection...
AND I WILL LEAD ALL OTHERS TO IT.
