[Opening]
H-hi! You're a detective huh? What- uh- can I help you with today?

[Show poster]
Oh... That's sad but I-I'm sorry I don't know this person.

[Dock's worker lines about working with Seren (152), (153)]
Uh- Th-that person must be mistaken- I've never seen that Chimeric before.
I mean- he didn't even... get my name close to right. Haha...

[Show vial]
Hey! D-did you steal that? I won't ask you to give it back but you should know you can't use that against me.
We ethically source all Etheris- we use the same trading line as Kog.
Kog was actually the one who set me up with this dealer- Kog and I were pretty great friends...

[Show line from ruth about it being chimeric blood]
No! Th-that's not right- it's not! I don't think you understand... Rutherian has always had beef with me.
Or- um- I mean he's always been against me. He's trying to find something to sully my reputation!
There's so much more at play here inspector...

[show beak-mask]
Kog had this? He told me he stopped going to that shady place...
That's what makes me and him different- er- him and I. I'd never resort to buying liquid Etheris from a place like that.
+fear

[present line about ethical sourcing +has fear]
Ah! I guess I... I did say Kog and I use the same source. Haha.
Hahaha.
HAHAHAHA.
PLEASE LEAVE.
+anger

[Opening with anger and fear]
PLEASE GET OUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM GOING THROUGH.
I'M LITERALLY JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE SPECTRE THREATENED ME WITH IF I DIDN'T DO HIS WORK?
...
Ha..... haaaaa.
...I'm sorry Jack... you can't- I can't let you go.
You have to understand... 

Seren is the saddest boy to ever live and you Cannot Change My Mind.
Also yes his real name is Ceren and he hides it. That plot point never came through but it's pretty big in like- the Actual Story.
