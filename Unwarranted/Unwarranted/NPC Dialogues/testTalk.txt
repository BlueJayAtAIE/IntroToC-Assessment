Hello!
This is a test of the dialogue system and how far it's come.
Remember to record all the lines you need before moving on.
I'd be witty and make an actual interaction here but I'm so lazy.
I just need to do something that takes no effort.

[Inquire on lines 1, 2, 4]
Yeah, I've been working on this for WAY too long. Please don't tell hi- oh.

It's good practice to be in! You may not be able to un-say something.
If someone is mad or scared enough, you may find something they've said changes.

I overthink these so much haha.

[After Inqury on line 2, remove line 0 from first chunk]

[Present line 9]
Ah, you caught I did just that huh? I'm really trying to think of everything.

[Present line 17]
Uh- I didn't mean that as in IM PUTTING EFFORT INTO A TEST CONVERSATION
GDI I GUESS I AM THOUGH?
